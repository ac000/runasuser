Overview
========

runasuser allows you specify what users can run programs as what user.

It's a bit like sudo, but the other way around. It lets you specify what
user to run as rather than what programs can be run.

See the runasuser(1) man page for details.


Install
=======

In order to run as other users runasuser needs to be able to setuid(). The
tradtional way to do this would be to set the setuid bit on the binary. e.g

	# chmod 4755 runasuser

However there is also another way. Using file capabilities you can give the
binary just the amount of privileges it needs and no more. In this case it
only needs the CAP_SETUID capability set, this can be done with the following

	# setcap cap_setuid=ep runasuser

and the binary only needs to be installed 0755


Configuration
=============

runasuser is configured via a simple text file, runasuser.conf. See the
runasuser.conf(5) man page.

runasuser looks in /etc and /usr/local/etc for this file.
